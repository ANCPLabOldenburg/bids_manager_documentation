# 3D Viewer

Every _nifti_ file has the `3D View` button that opens a new window that allows you to quickly visualize and inspect the anatomy and quality of your dataset. The panel allows you to scroll through slices, switch the render mode or intensity ranges. 

Any change you make only affects the visualization, it won't affect the data and it won't be saved for future sessions. So feel free to experiment what parameters work the best for your dataset.

```{admonition} Quick visualization

2. Increase the `Colour Intensity`
