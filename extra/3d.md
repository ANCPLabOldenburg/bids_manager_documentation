# 3D Viewer

<img src="../static/3d/01_intro_3.gif" alt="intro" width="600px">

Every _nifti_ file has the `3D View` button that opens a new window that allows you to quickly visualize and inspect the anatomy and quality of your dataset. The panel allows you to scroll through slices, switch the render mode or intensity ranges. Any change you make only affects the visualization, it won't affect the data and it won't be saved for future sessions. So feel free to experiment what parameters work the best for your dataset.

* Panel Placement
* Aggregation: RMS(DTI), Mean Value, Max value, First volume
* Render Mode: Point cloud / Surface Mesh
* Threshold [0 1]: "minimun normalised intensity included in the rendering" (point cloud)
* Point Size: "Marker diameter for point-cloud rendering." (point cloud)
* Iso level: "iso surface level within the normalized volume" (0-1) (surface mesh)

Rendering options:
* Colormap: "select the matplotlib for voxel intensities" The colour bar at the bottom will change and will show you the  
* Opacity[0 1]: "Global alpha applied to rendering points or surface mesh"
* Colour Intensity [0.1 2]: "Scale factor applied to RGB values after colormpa lookup"
* Maximun points: "Upper bound on voxes displayed on point-cloud mode" the higher the better but it might slow down your pc
* Downsample step: "Manual voxel stride applied before rendering" 0 is automatic, more is recommended, it also slows down your pc
* Marchings cubes step: "Sampling stirde for marchin cubes when computing iso-surfaces"
* Show axes: It will show x, y and z axes
* Axis thickness: Line width of anatomical axes
* Show axis label: Superior, Posterior, Anterior, Inferior, Right, Left

Slice planes
* Sagittal: Left - Right toggle
* Coronal: Posterior - Anterior toggel
* Axial: Inferior - Superior toggel

Lightning
* Enable lightning: only possible to disable and edit in the surface mesh. 
* Azimuth: Horizontal direction of the light source relative to the mesh.
* Elevation: Vertical angle of the light source relative to the mesh.
* Intensity: Diffuse lightning strength [0.1-3]. Ambient light stays constant.

Summary: At the end there is a summary with all the values you used:
- Point cloud (number of voxels), theshold value, opacity and point size
- Downsample step 1 (auto 0 / manual if >0)
- ~ total voxes > threshold 5,586 (value)
- Lightning enabled (default and not disable for point cloud)

```{admonition} Quick visualization
:class: dropdown

1. Drag the `Threshold` to a low value.
2. Increase the `Colour Intensity`
3. Increase the `Maximun Points`
4. Increase the `Downsample step`
5. Choose a `Slice planes` and explore the toggles.
