# Welcome!
BIDS-Manager is a free open-science tool that converts **DICOM** folders into **BIDS compliant** datasets. It was developed by the [Applied Neurocognitive Psychology Lab (ANCP Lab)](https://uol.de/en/applied-neurocognitive-psychology) as an **user-friendly**, PyQt-based **GUI**.

Currently, BIDS-Manager is the best converter in the market, as it was build on heudiconv for the core DICOM-to-BIDS conversion and extended its functionality with a metadata-based scanning system, an interface that improves metadata annotation (viewing and editing) and conversion settings, and advance visualization options for a wide range of BIDS compliant datasets. 


```{admonition} Comptability update!
:class: tip

Currently, BIDS-Manager runs smoothly both on Windows (x86), Linux (x86) and macOS (ARM)! 🚀

```

This documentation includes an installation guide and a tutorial on how to use the different modules within BIDS-manager, and it doesn't require deep technical programming knowledge.

## Requirements for this tutorial
* Basic understanding of [BIDS](./extra/bids).
* Python 3.10 (installed automatically with BIDS-Manager if not already available).
* A DICOM dataset— if you don’t have one, a [dummy dataset](./extra/download) is available so you can follow along with the tutorial.

## I've got a question!
If you have any questions or encounter difficulties while working with BIDS Manager, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. You can send an e-mail to karel.mauricio.lopez.vilaret@uni-oldenburg.de or create a [`New Issue`](https://github.com/ANCPLabOldenburg/BIDS-Manager/issues) in the BIDS-Manager github.
